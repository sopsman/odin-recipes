    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        The classic combination of coconut milk, sticky rice,
        and sweet ripe mango has been a popular Thai dessert for centuries. In the U.S. most people know of mango sticky rice (or khao niaow ma muang) from going to Thai restaurants, 
        but this gluten-free treat is actually incredibly easy 
        to make at home

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>

        <li>In a bowl wash rice well in several changes of cold water until water is clear. 
            Soak rice in cold water to cover overnight</li>
            <li>Drain rice well in a sieve.
                 Set sieve over a large deep saucepan of simmering water 
                 (sieve should not touch water) and steam rice, covered with a kitchen towel and a lid, 30 to 40 minutes,
                 or until tender (check water level in pan occasionally, adding more water if necessary).</li>
                 <li>While rice is cooking, in a small saucepan bring 1 cup coconut milk
                     to a boil with ⅓ cup sugar and salt, stirring until sugar is dissolved,
    and remove from heat. Keep mixture warm.</li>
                      <li>Transfer cooked rice to a bowl and stir in coconut-milk mixture.Let rice stand, covered, 30 minutes, or until coconut-milk mixture is absorbed. 
     Rice may be prepared up to this
      point 2 hours ahead and kept covered at room temperature</li>
     <li>While rice is standing, in cleaned small 
        pan slowly boil remaining ⅓ cup coconut milk with remaining 3 tablespoons 
        sugar, stirring occasionally, 1 minute.
